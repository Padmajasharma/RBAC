## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for a Content Management System (CMS). The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.


## Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with different permissions for different roles
- Logging of user activities
- Assign Role-Based Permissions or Direct Permissions to Users
- Middleware for checking permissions before accessing routes


## Example Use Case: CMS for a News Website

In this case, a CMS is used by a news agency to manage articles, editors, authors and more. Different roles would have different access permissions. Some example roles might include:

### Admin
- Full access to all content, users, and settings.
- Can create, edit, and delete articles, and user accounts.
- Can view system logs, configure settings, and assign roles.

### Editor
- Can create and edit articles, but not delete them.
- Can view the content published on the site and edit drafts, but cannot manage users or settings.

### Author
- Can only create new articles and submit them for approval.
- Cannot edit or delete existing content and cannot access other usersâ€™ work.

### Viewer
- Can view published content, but cannot create or edit articles.
- Typically a read-only role for visitors or authorized users.
